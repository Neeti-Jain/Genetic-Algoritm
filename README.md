By this code we will Learn about Genetic Algorithm.

WHAT IS GENETIC ALGORITHM
A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of 
natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

HOW DO WE PERFORM GENETIC ALGORITHM USING 
The process of natural selection starts with the selection of fittest individuals from a population. They produce offspring which 
inherits the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next generation. If parents have better fitness, their offspring 
will be better than parents and have a better chance at surviving. 
This process keeps on iterating and at the end, a generation with the fittest individuals will be found.

WHAT ARE THE STEPS INVOLVED IN GENETIC ALGORITHM

1. Initial population
   The process begins with a set of individuals which is called a Population. 
   Each individual is a solution to the problem you want to solve.
   
2. Fitness function
  The fitness function determines how fit an individual is (the ability of an individual to compete with other individuals). 
  It gives a fitness score to each individual. 
  The probability that an individual will be selected for reproduction is based on its fitness score.

3. Selection
   The idea of selection phase is to select the fittest individuals and let them pass their genes to the next generation.
   
4. Crossover
   Crossover is the most significant phase in a genetic algorithm. For each pair of parents to be mated, a crossover 
   point is chosen at random from within the genes.
   
5. Mutation
     In certain new offspring formed, some of their genes can be subjected to a mutation with a low random probability. 
     This implies that some of the bits in the bit string can be flipped.
